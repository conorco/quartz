# Quartz by Konor

Welcome to my [website](https://quartz.konor.fr) repository. It's a fork of [quartz](https://quartz.jzaho.xyz), which is a tool to publish notes in Markdown (from Obsidian mostly) in a cool-looking website, freely. It's based on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), you can look up all of that if you're interested.
